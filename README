Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Compilation Steps:
  $ cd apps/deepstream-opencv-test/
  $ make

To run:
  $ ./deepstream-opencv-test <uri>
e.g.
  $ ./deepstream-opencv-test file:///home/nvidia/video1.mp4

This document describes the sample deepstream-opencv-test application.

This sample builds on top of the deepstream-test1 sample to demonstrate how to:
* Use dsexample plugin to do opencv processing.
* Use a uridecodebin so that any type of input (e.g. RTSP/File), any GStreamer
  supported container format, and any codec can be used as input.

Refer to the deepstream-test1 sample documentation for an example of simple
single-stream inference, bounding-box overlay, and rendering.

This sample accepts any type of stream as a input. dsexample plugin has been
added to show image processing using opencv. dsexample gaussian blurs the detected
objects from nvinfer while processing in full-frame=0 mode.

Since, dsexample plugin requires RGB input for blurring with opencv, nvvideoconvert
has been used before it to convert the NV12 format to RGBA input format for dsexample.

"blur-objects" property is enabled in dsexample plugin to blur the detected objects only when processing
in object mode is used. i.e. "full-frame" property is disabled.
